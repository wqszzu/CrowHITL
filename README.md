# CrowHITL: A Human-in-the-Loop Visual Interaction System for Reinforcement Learning in Spatial Crowdsourcing  

**CrowHITL** is an open-source system designed to enhance the learning efficiency and quality of **reinforcement learning models (RLMs)** in **spatial crowdsourcing (SC) platforms** like Uber, DiDi, and Amazon.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Management**: Efficiently collect, clean, and store spatiotemporal data from SC platforms and learning data from RLMs.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: Gain insights through three powerful visualization tools:  
  - 📍 **Worker Visualization**: Analyze spatiotemporal patterns of workers.  
  - 🎯 **Task Visualization**: Explore task distributions and trends.  
  - 📊 **RLMs Visualization**: Monitor and evaluate model learning performance.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop Interaction**: Guide RLMs via an intuitive interface, enabling **better model adaptation and optimization**.  

## 📌 Why CrowHITL?  
✔ **User-Friendly**: Designed for model developers and data management experts.  
✔ **Scalable**: Supports large-scale spatiotemporal datasets.  
✔ **Efficient**: Enhances model learning through human feedback and interactive analysis.
